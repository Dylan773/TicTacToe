# TicTacToe
A PvP (Player vs Player) TicTacToe game written in Java, using JavaFX for the GUI. No frameworks or GUI builders were used in the development of this app.

No design pattern was strictly followed such as MVC architecture, the primary goal was to extend upon JavaFX skills learnt in university studies. Potential further development of this app will include a single player mode vs the CPU and modifications to improve quality of code if neccessary.
